# unit-4-game (Treasure Game)
In this game, the user is trying to get the total value to **exactly** equal the Goal value.
The problem is that the values of each gem are unknown. Clicking on a gem will add its value 
to the total.

## For each round: 
The goal value is randomly selected by the computer and will be a number between 19 and 120.
Each gem is assigned a random value between 1 and 12. Some gems may have the same value.
When the goal value is reached or exceeded, the round ends and the number of wins or losses is incremented.
A new goal value is automatically chosen and a new round begins!

## Additional feature:
The user may select to work with anywhere from 2 to 6 gems. Changing the number of gems automatically starts a new round.
